- [x] **phase:ui1** — Full UI overhaul (Framer Motion, Radix Slider, minimal dark theme, custom ship SVG markers, organic MPA blobs, sliding feedstock control, spring animations throughout)
- [x] **U1** — Mode switcher: sliding segmented control in header (`mode-seg` / `mode-seg-track` / `mode-seg-btn`), spring-animated pill indicator, `header-center` absolutely positioned
- [x] **U4** — Global Intelligence UI: organic OAE zone blobs with glow layers, zone cards matching ship-card style (pip + name + label + score + chevron), stagger animations, CalCOFI stat-cards, zone detail popup (top-center AnimatePresence slide-down), discovery zone cards clickable, `zoneTier()` handles string/number scores from Mapbox

## UI Phase 2 — Completed

- [x] **U2** — Ship marker tooltips: `ShipMarker` accepts `name/lat/lon/co2` props; `AnimatePresence` tooltip above marker shows name, status badge, CO₂, coordinates on hover
- [x] **U3** — AI typewriter: `TypewriterText` component in `AIPanel.tsx` types each character at 12ms/char with blinking `▌` cursor; recommendations stagger in as list items after typewriter finishes
- [x] **U6** — Loading skeletons: `FleetPanel` accepts `isLoading` prop; shows 3 shimmer skeleton cards (CSS `@keyframes shimmer`) while fleet data loads; stat tiles also shimmer
- [x] **U7** — Count-up animation: `useCountUp` hook in `ImpactMetrics.tsx` animates from previous value to new value with cubic ease-out over 700ms using `requestAnimationFrame`
- [x] **U8** — Header status chips: `/health` polled every 5s; shows latency (ms), Gemma ✓/✗, **GPU ✓/✗** (Julia availability — not "Mock/Live") as small color-coded chips; fade-in on first load
- [x] **U9** — Responsive: at 1100px sidebar narrows to 240px and chips hide; at 860px sidebars collapse entirely so map takes full width
- [x] Mapbox token configured
- [x] Ollama + Gemma 2 setup
- [x] Three.js and wire up a canvas layer (`three` + `@types/three` installed; `ThreeLayer.ts` implements `mapboxgl.CustomLayerInterface`)
- [x] Isosurface bounding box (`buildIsosurfaceBBox()` renders wireframe box + floor plane + corner pillars for Ω_aragonite > 4.5 cells)
- [x] Streamline velocity vectors (`buildVelocityArrows()` derives flow from alkalinity gradient, renders as `THREE.ArrowHelper` instances)
- [x] Mode-aware layout scaffold (`ModeSelector` with Global Intelligence / Mission Control / Route Planning tabs)
- [x] Mode 1: Global Ocean Intelligence (Pacific-centered map, OAE zones, CalCOFI circles, MPA overlay, `/discover` integration)
- [x] Mode 3: Route Planning (Click-to-add waypoints, route LineString, per-segment CO₂ estimates, AIS traffic markers)
- [x] CalCOFI oceanographic data integration (`GET /oceanographic`, 18 real stations in `data/mock/calcofi_stations.json`)
- [x] Enhanced MarineTraffic vessel traffic (`GET /traffic`, 5 mock AIS vessels, directional triangle markers)
- [x] Discovery Mode / AI-recommended deployment zones (`POST /discover` using SpatialIntelligenceAgent, glowing pulse markers)
- [x] Google ADK setup and base agent scaffold (`backend/agents/base.py`, `POST /agent` endpoint, Gemini 2.0 Flash + fallback)
- [x] Agent 1: Spatial Intelligence (`backend/agents/spatial_intelligence.py`, site selection from CalCOFI grid)
- [x] Agent 2: Geochemist / Dispatcher (`backend/agents/geochemist.py`, function calling, `/analyze` integration)
- [x] Agent 3: Verdict Logger / MRV proof (`compute_mrv_hash()` in `main.py`, SHA-256 hash, `data/mrv_log.jsonl`, "✓ MRV" badge)
- [x] Pre-compute rich simulation fallback data (50×50 directional Gaussian plume in `plume_simulation.json`)

---

## Phase 3 — Live Data & Simulation — Completed

- [x] **Live ocean data**: `POST /simulate` fetches real SST from NOAA ERDDAP (jplMURSST41) and salinity/MLD/alkalinity from nearest CalCOFI station; falls back gracefully when ERDDAP is unreachable. Source shown as `live-conditions` badge in SimulationPanel.
- [x] **Physics-based plume**: `generate_plume_from_conditions()` in `main.py` — MLD controls cross-track spread, vessel speed controls along-track length, temperature drives olivine dissolution; replaces static mock Gaussian.
- [x] **Correct ship positions**: All three ships placed in Pacific Ocean off California coast (Pacific Guardian: 33.80°N 119.50°W, Ocean Sentinel: 32.50°N 119.20°W, Reef Protector: 35.10°N 121.90°W). Backend ocean state fetch updated to use Pacific Guardian coordinates (was erroneously using downtown LA).
- [x] **Continuous ship animation**: `advanceShip()` advances each ship along its heading at its speed every 1500 ms client-side; no backend calls during animation. `TICK_MS=1500`, `SIM_REFRESH_MS=45000`.
- [x] **Simulation controls**: SimulationPanel has ⏸ Pause / ▶ Resume and ↺ Reset buttons; elapsed time row with pulsing live-dot.
- [x] **Ship heading rotation**: `ShipMarker` accepts `heading` prop; SVG rotates to vessel bearing with 1.2 s CSS transition.
- [x] **Plume follows ship**: `PlumeHeatmap` accepts `centerLat`/`centerLon` props; heatmap recenters on the active (deploying) ship each frame.
- [x] **Sim status bar**: Bottom-center overlay in Mission Control shows Live/Paused dot, elapsed time, and "Fetching conditions…" spinner.
- [x] **`POST /hotspot-impact`**: Deep-dive metric endpoint — fetches real ocean state at site, runs physics plume, returns CO₂ projections (1/5/10/50 yr), ocean chemistry (pH, aragonite saturation), plume geometry, economics (carbon credits), and safety assessment.
- [x] **Impact analysis panel**: GlobalIntelligence fetches `POST /hotspot-impact` for each AI-discovered zone in parallel after `/discover`. Clicking a zone opens right sidebar with full metric-driven `ImpactPanel` (CO₂ removal grid, revenue projections, ocean chemistry rows, plume metrics, safety badge, raw ocean state).
- [x] **Error boundary**: `ErrorBoundary` class component in `App.tsx` wraps `<main>`; catches any render errors and displays them on-screen instead of a blank black page.
- [x] **Lazy ThreeLayer import**: `PlumeThreeLayer` loaded via dynamic `import('../ThreeLayer')` inside `handleMapLoad` so Three.js module never blocks or crashes the initial React render. Existing layer removed before re-adding on mode switch (`reuseMaps` guard).

## Implementation Order

Tasks below are ordered for execution. Complete each group before moving to the next — later phases depend on earlier ones being stable.

---

## Priority 0 — Critical Path

### 1. Validate GB10 Julia/CUDA
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** ✅ DONE — GB10 CUDA validated. Julia 1.12.5 + CUDA 13.0 local toolkit, driver 580, sm_121 Blackwell, 113 GiB available. Required `CUDA.set_runtime_version!(v"13.0", local_toolkit=true)` to resolve 12.6→13.0 version mismatch. Live simulation path is confirmed working.

---

## Remaining Tasks

### 2D Section Cut (vertical cross-section matrix)
**Priority:** LOW
**Effort:** 2 hours
**What:** Add a horizontal slider to the UI that selects a depth level `z`. Render a colored flat plane at that z-slice showing alkalinity concentration as a texture. Use `THREE.PlaneGeometry` with a `DataTexture` mapped from the 2D slice of `fields.alkalinity`.
**Why:** Section cuts let judges see subsurface plume structure without needing full 3D navigation
**Depends on:** ThreeLayer.ts (complete)
**Status:** ✅ DONE — Added depth slider in Mission Control "3D Visualization" panel; `buildSectionCut()` renders a colored plane at the selected depth with alkalinity mapped to a gradient texture (blue→cyan→green→yellow→orange)

### Demo script preparation
**Priority:** HIGH
**Effort:** 30–45 minutes
**What:** Write a 3-minute narrated demo script hitting all four judging tracks:
- **Sustainability:** Show Mode 1 Global Intelligence → site selection → safe deployment → MRV proof hash
- **ASUS Challenge:** Mention GB10 Grace Blackwell running live Oceananigans.jl LES simulation
- **Arista "Connect the Dots":** Show fleet dashboard → 3 ships → route planning → conflict avoidance
- **Google Gemma:** Show Gemma 2 safety assessment → agent function calls → CO₂ projection

Include explicit fallback paths: if Julia fails → pre-computed data; if Ollama fails → rule-based text; if Mapbox fails → screenshot backup.
**Status:** TODO

## Stretch Goals (If Time Permits)

### Three.js true 3D volumetric rendering
**Priority:** LOW
**What:** Replace the isosurface wireframe with a real marching-cubes mesh using custom GLSL shaders for volume ray-casting.
**Status:** DEFERRED

### Marine health score
**Priority:** LOW
**What:** Add a composite ecosystem health index (chlorophyll proxy, biodiversity risk, MPA proximity) to the Impact Metrics overlay.
**Status:** DEFERRED

### Live MarineTraffic API
**Priority:** LOW
**What:** Replace mock AIS data with real MarineTraffic API calls (requires API key).
**Status:** DEFERRED
